# Homebrew
**Homebrew** is a term frequently applied to video games or other software produced by hobbyists and amateur developers targeting proprietary hardware platforms. This document is intended to be an up-to-date list of resources for homebrew developers.

## Documentation
* [NESDEV Programming Guide](http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Programming_guide)

## Sites

## Integrated Development Environments
These allow a developer to create games either mostly or wholly within a single application interface without resorting to multiple programs and collections of scripts.
